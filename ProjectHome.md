A plethora of text editors exist in the software world today. Figurate adds one more to the list, with some subtle differences that you may find appealing.

Some features include:

### Cross-platform ###

Figurate is built on the Java platform, and is available anywhere a Java 6 runtime is found (i.e. Windows, Linux, Mac OSX)

### Tabbed Editors ###

Figurate uses tabs to provide quick access to open editors. Editors may also be docked and detached, allowing you an extensive array of editor configurations.

### Filesystem Explorer ###

The _Filesystem Explorer_ sidebar provides a convenient way to view and open files your local filesystem.

### Spell Checker ###

The built-in _Spell Checker_ provided real-time feedback on spelling errors in source file comments and plain text files.
